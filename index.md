### First instantaneous, collaborative genomic annotation editor available on the Web.

Apollo is designed to support geographically dispersed researchers, and the work of a distributed community is coordinated through automatic synchronization: all edits in one client are instantly pushed to all other clients, allowing users to see annotation updates from collaborators in real-time during the editing process.

There are no installation requirements for Annotators!

Apollo is a plug-in for JBrowse, adding User-created Annotations and DNA tracks to the familiar main window.

Try Apollo at our Public Demo, built with the genome of several organism including the honey bee (Apis mellifera).

### Highlighted features

* In addition to genes and pseudogenes, users can annotate ncRNAs (snRNA, snoRNA, tRNA, rRNA), miRNAs, repeat regions, and transposable elements; each annotation type has its own configuration of the ' Information Editor'.
* History tracking with undo/redo functions is available.
* Users are able to directly set an annotation to a specific state, choosing from the 'History' display.
* Adding and updating PubMed IDs will prompt users with a publication title to confirm their submission.
* Gene Ontology (GO) terms are supported and GO ID auto-completion has been incorporated.
* Users may access a 'Recent Changes' page.
* Help page with Apollo specific content is available.
